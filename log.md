# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 82: August 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Made good progress on ex #46 Word Counter.  It's parsing the file, counting the words, and sorting them in descending frequency. I learned about tree maps and sorting them by their values (instead of their keys) by converting them to an array list and then sorting with a custom comparator.

### Day 46: July 24, 2017

### Day 44: July 22, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Refactoring exercise #19 BMI calculator in order to properly handle division by 0. I added a unit test for division by 0 and discovered that the program was not returning an exception! I learned that with doubles, division by 0 returns Infinity instead of an arithmetic exception like what happens with integers. That compounded with the Math.round function I'm using, is returning a huge number (which is actually a numeric overflow). I don't have much code to show for today's work since I spent most of my time investigating why it was returning a huge number when dividing by 0 instead of an exception.

**Thoughts**:  Missed one day, but the important thing is I'm back in the game.

### Day 42: July 19, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started exercise #20 Multi State Tax Calculator. Got all the functionality working; did manual tests to make sure results are correct. Tomorrow will add unit tests.

**Thoughts**:  Ran into a few issues with nested if and scanner nextLine method, but was able to figure them out and get the code working.

**Link to work**: [SalesTaxCalculator](https://github.com/yasrodriguez/57-exercises/blob/master/src/ex20multiStateSalesTaxCalculator/SalesTaxCalculator.java)

**Link to work**: Coming soon...I need to clean up my class files and upload them to Git.

### Day 37: July 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started exercise #19 BMI Calculator. I'm trying to think ahead of time how I will test the input validation function. As part of that I'm learning about Exception Handling.

### Day 33: July 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started exercise #18 Temperature Converter. I got it working.  I can tell the code needs some cleaning up, so tomorrow I will write the unit tests and then see how I can refactor the code. 

**Thoughts**:  I want to write clean code, but I need to focus on solving the problem first. 

**Link to work**: [TemperatureConverter](https://github.com/yasrodriguez/57-exercises/blob/master/src/ex18temperatureConverter/TemperatureConverter.java)

### Day 32: July 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Spent more time trying to figure out how to create the unit test for the validation method.  I made changes to the class under the test, the test case, etc. with no success, so I reverted back my changes. I've decided to move on, in order not to get stuck, and come back to figure this out at a later time.

**Thoughts**:  

**Link to work**:  

### Day 31: July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Trying to understand how to create a unit test for a validation method that reads input from the console using a scanner and checks to see whether it's numeric.
