### Day 31: July 8, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Trying to understand how to create a unit test for a validation method that reads input from the console using a scanner and checks to see whether it's numeric.  I did a "proof of concept" to test how to redirect the scanner to use a string provided in the program instead of user input on the console.
